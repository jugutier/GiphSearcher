# GiphSearcher

Have you tried sending GIFs through whatsapp recently?

If so you've probably seen something like this:

Ours ends up looking like this:

![Our version of a GIF search Grid](https://github.com/jugutier/GiphSearcher/raw/master/Screenshots/GIFme.gif)

This is a weekend project with the goal replicating that GIF search grid using the latest greatest libraries out there.

All of the libraries used for this project where new to me at the beginning of the project.


### The libraries in use, the latest fad:

- [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/)
- [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya/)
- [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) 
- MoyaModelMappers 
- RxDatasources
- etc...
